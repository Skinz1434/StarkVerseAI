# StarkVerseAI Unity Sync

This repository contains assets generated by Codex agents. Use `scripts/sync_unity_assets.py` to copy the generated content into the local Unity project and trigger an import.

## Usage

1. Ensure the `UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` and `UNITY_EXECUTABLE` variables in `scripts/sync_unity_assets.py` match your environment.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python scripts/sync_unity_assets.py
```

The script pulls the latest repo changes, copies files from `AI_Generated/` into `C:\Users\skinn\IronAydan\Assets\AI_Generated\`, updates `project_log.json`, and invokes the `StarkverseImporter` editor script in Unity to reimport the assets.

The `UnityScripts/StarkverseImporter.cs` script can also be run manually from the Unity Editor via **Tools → Starkverse → Sync AI Generated Content**.
