# Carnotaurus FBX Model Instructions

This repository does not include a pre-made `carnotaurus_model.fbx`. To obtain a compatible model for Unity:

1. Visit [Quaternius Free 3D Assets](https://quaternius.com/packs/free/cartooncarnivorousdinosaurs.html) and download the "Cartoon Carnivorous Dinosaurs" pack.
2. The pack includes a low-poly Carnotaurus model in FBX format with a basic rig and texture.
3. Import the model into Blender or your 3D tool of choice.
4. Ensure the model is scaled to roughly twice human height, origin at the feet, and oriented forward.
5. Export as `carnotaurus_model.fbx` with the default brown/gray texture applied.

Alternatively, you can model one in Blender using these guidelines:

- Keep geometry under 10k polygons.
- Create simple eyes and mouth with no gore.
- Leave tail and arms with separate bones for later rigging.
- Use a single 1k texture with a brown/gray palette.

Save the resulting file to `AI_Generated/Prefabs/Dinosaurs/carnotaurus_model.fbx`.
